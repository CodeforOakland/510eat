=============
well here we go, this was a PHP project but we (I) am changing it to django. I think I
can hack something cool together in a couple of weeks. all the other team members abandoned it and
never contacted me. No code was really ever contributed by them to this line, so I am going to
reboot it on my own.

What will it do?
-------------

* fast elastic search of inspection data
* green yellow red filtering
* works with location and senses android and ios for mobile version
* maybe twilio SMS (TBD)
